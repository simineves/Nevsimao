### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I love using my technical skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions that improve user experiences. Looking for a dynamic and innovative team that values collaboration and innovation to leverage my skills and drive the success of the organization.

- I bring experience as a Technical Support Engineer on the Tech Ops team at [Extra Card](https://extra.app/) where I honed my technical and problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment. Prior to that, I served as an Information Technology Technician on the Support team at [AiCure](https://www.aicure.com/). I'm currently seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise and passion for technology to drive success for a dynamic team.
